# Personal Portfolio
  Created by Bethany Proctor 

  ## Description
  Welcome to the Portfolio of Bethany Proctor! This project serves to show off how much I have learned in the past six months while attending a full-stack bootcamp. Built with React, I have displayed my skills and a few previous projects that I am proud of, as well as a contact form if you have any questions, concerns, or business inquiries. This project itself was a great learning experience for me, especially in regards to the intricacies and variability of React. I am in awe of how much I have learned in such a short time, and I hope that I can share my learnings and successes with you as you look over my portfolio.
